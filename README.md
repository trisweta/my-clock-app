# my-clock-app
Clock application that displays the current time constantly and has options to either use a stopwatch or set a timer!
The use of __setInterval__ was utilised for achieving real-time clock updates, demonstrating asynchronous programming. DOM manipulation techniques, such as __getElementById__
and property assignments, which were applied for dynamic interaction with HTML elements. Managing time using the Date object, along with calculations for the stopwatch and timer,
highlighted the significance of effective time handling in web applications. User input and validation procedures were integrated for enhanced interactivity, particularly
in the timer functionality. The use of __clearInterval__ in the stopwatch and timer components were implemented. The project's modular structure,
organized into functions, facilitated code readability and maintenance, offers a comprehensive exploration of fundamental JavaScript concepts.
